# Array-Based Sequence
In the chapter, we explore Python's various sequence class, namely the built-in `list`, `tuple` and `str` classes. There is significant commonality between these classes, most notably: each supports indexing to access an individual element of a squence, using a syntx such as $seq[k]$, and each uses a low-level concept known as an `array` to represent the sequence. However, there are significant differences in the abstractions that these classes represent.
